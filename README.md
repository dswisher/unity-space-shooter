# Space Shooter

This is mainly a submission for the final project in the Unity "Junior Programmer" mission.
It is a POC of what a space shooter could look like.

## Goals

There will be multiple types of enemy ships, each with their own behavior, to illustrate inheritance and polymorphism.
Each ship will have one or more guns, and each gun will have a `Shoot` method, illustrating abstraction.
Parameterized settings, such as fire rate for a ship, will be `private`, with the `[SerializeField]` attribute, illustrating encapsulation.
